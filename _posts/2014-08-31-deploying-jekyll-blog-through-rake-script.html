<div class="post">
  <p>This blog is powered by Jekyll and I use Github pages as web server.</p>
  <h4>Branch structure in Github</h4>

  <p>Github by default publish the contents of the master branch as a github page. So i have created two branches in
    the repository. </p>

  <p><strong>source:</strong> contains Jekyll based folder structure. _drafts, _posts, _site etc. All the new posts
    are added in the drafts folder first and then once its written fully it is then moved to _posts folder and are
    then ready to be published.</p>

  <p><strong>master:</strong> is simply a generated content from the rake script. This branch has all the HTML files
    that are generated
    using Jekyll gem.</p>

  <h4>Folder structure in Dev box</h4>

  <p>I have both the branches checked out in different folders. Both these folders are present in the same level (will
    be useful while generating output)</p>

  <h4>Rake script</h4>

  <h5>To generate HTML</h5>

  <p>I have the Rakefile in the root level of my source branch. The rake task mentioned below will create HTML
    equivalent inside the _site folder.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">
task :generate do
  Jekyll::Site.new(Jekyll.configuration({
    "source"      => ".",
    "destination" => "_site"
  })).process
end
    </pre>

  <h5>To publish in Github</h5>

  <p>This task copies the entire _site folder into the master branch (locally). This is why i need to checkout both
    master and source branches separately and keep them in the same level.</p>

  <p>After copying the contents, simply it switches to the master branch and does a git push.</p>

  <p>Once the changes are pushed into github's master branch the changes are then reflected in your site
    immediately.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
task :publish => [:generate] do
  cp_r "_site/.", LOCAL_DIR_NAME
  cp ".travis.yml", LOCAL_DIR_NAME
  pwd = Dir.pwd
  Dir.chdir LOCAL_DIR_NAME
  system "git add --all"
  message = "Site updated at #{Time.now.utc}"
  system "git commit -m #{message.inspect}"
  system "git push origin master:refs/heads/master"
  Dir.chdir pwd
end
    </pre>
