<div class="post">

    <p>Using Spring security we were building an application which has 2 types of users Internal and External.
        Our requirement was</p>

    <ol>
        <li> Internal and External users have different idle timeouts.</li>
        <li>External user's session should be invalidated after 30 mins. Irrespective of whether the user is active or
            not.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Setting up Idle timeout in Spring security</h4>

    <p>Spring provides out of box option to configure an idle timeout value.
        This invalidation is done by Spring security and happens while making a request after specified amount of
        time.</p>

    <p>We were able to achieve this by setting up <span class="inline">setMaxInactiveIntervalInSeconds</span> on the
        session object while creation.</p>

    <h4>Setting up Max timeout in Spring security</h4>

    <p>The above technique can be used only for setting the idle time. But our second scenario is to invalidate the
        session irrespective of whether the user is active or not.</p>

    <p> We ended up writing a custom filter which to invalidate the session manually whenever the session age is
        greater than the specified value.</p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/prasann/0dd68a2e918804d25e31298b382c4938.js"></script>

    <p> This filter will invalidate the session when the maximum time has reached for that session. </p>
