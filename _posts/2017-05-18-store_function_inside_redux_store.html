<div class="post">
  <p><a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> is a predictable state container for Javascript. Redux state has to be serializable all
  the time.</p>
  <p>Object serialization is the process of converting an object's state to a string from which it can later be restored.</p>

  <p>So, if you are trying to store a function inside the Redux state, you need to serialize them before persisting.</p>

  <blockquote>Storing functions inside redux state is not a best practice in general. So try to avoid it.</blockquote>

  <p>Javascript functions can be serialized quite easily, the challenge is in retrieving them from the store to execute.</p>

  <p>Below are the helper functions for persisting functions inside Redux state.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  //Returns a string
  export const serializeFunction = (func) => (func.toString());
  //serializeFunction(()=>console.log('Hello!!'))
  // Output ==> "()=>console.log('Hello!!')"
  </pre>

  <p>
  The function to be stored in the state should be converted into string using <span class="inline">serializeFunction</span>.
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  //Returns a function
  export const deserializeFunction = (funcString) => (new Function(`return ${funcString}`)());
  </pre>

  <p>
    Convert the string from the redux store into a function using <span class="inline">deserializeFunction</span>
  </p>
