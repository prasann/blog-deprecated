<div class="post">
<div id="_mcePaste">I just saw this widget (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/" target="_blank">Android Wheel</a>) and instantly got attracted to it. Just wanted to get this into my app. So here are the steps i followed to integrate this into my application.</div>

<li> Import the project into Eclipse through Svn import (File-&gt;Import) from google-code (http://android-wheel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk)</li>
<li> Once you import the project in the Eclipse, Right click on the project -&gt; Properties -&gt; Choose android tab and check the IsLibrary option</li>
<li> Now Right click on your project -&gt; Properties -&gt; Choose android tab -&gt; In the Library section add the imported project.</li><br/>
<div>That's it you are good to go now. The Apps in the Wheel Demo are really good enough to guide you through.</div>
