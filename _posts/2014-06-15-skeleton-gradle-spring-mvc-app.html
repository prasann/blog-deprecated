<div class="post">
	<p>Will try to list down few of my learnings to set up a Spring MVC app with Gradle. And also this time i tried using Servlet 3.0 spec which means no .xml files for Spring configuration.</p>

	<p> Refer to the GitHub repo for the source code. I will be giving some notes on the code.</p>

	<h4>1. Create build.gradle file</h4>
	<p> build.gradle can be pretty much simple to start with. I started with adding java and war plugin followed by adding dependencies to the Spring artifacts. I have to define <pre>runtime 'javax.servlet:jstl:1.2'</pre> to make sure it doesn't get packaged as part of the war.</p>
	
	<p> Then thought it will be awesome to start the application in one command instead of building the war and deploying it in local instance. After some initial searching landed onto this <a href="https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-cargo-plugin">Cargo plugin</a> This lets you to configure the server of your choice and get it working. So after doing some basic configuration got this working.</p>
	Now <pre>gradle war cargoRunLocal</pre> since the task name is not so user friendly, just added an alias to it.
	<pre>
		task serve(dependsOn: cargoRunLocal) << {
		}
	</pre>
	<h4>Setup Spring</h4>
	<h4>Setup Unit Tests</h4>
	<h4>Setup Logging</h4>
	compile 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.7'

	compile 'log4j:log4j:1.2.17'
	
	src/main/resources -> log4j properties
