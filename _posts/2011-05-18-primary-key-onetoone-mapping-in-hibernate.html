<div class="post">
<p>Today was trying to join two tables using its Primary keys using Hibernate. Here is what I tried to do:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">@Table(name = "customer")
@Entity
public class Customer {
    @Id
    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "customer_id",updatable = false)
    private Credentials credentials;
}</pre>
<p>I was constantly getting an error stating invalid column name. Later then I realized that its not possible have Join in the Primary-Key and bind to a custom object. This forced me to have a Auto-generated Id as a key to the table and named it as the primary key. This is how my code looked after modification.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">@Table(name = "customer")
@Entity
public class Customer {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private long id;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "customer_id",updatable = false)
    private Credentials credentials;
}</pre>
</div>
