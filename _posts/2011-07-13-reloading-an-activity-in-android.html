<div class="post">
<div id="_mcePaste">More often i wanted to reload an activity to refresh the contents of an page. I have seen many ways to do this in Android world and i always puzzled about the best approach.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">However these are some of the approaches that i took . I found the following two approaches a lot cleaner as they kill the existing intent and restart.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste"></div>
<p><strong>Approach 1:</strong></p>
<div id="_mcePaste">
<pre class="prettyprint">Intent intent = getIntent();
finish();
startActivity(intent);</pre>
</div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Approach 2:</strong></p>
<div id="_mcePaste">
<pre class="prettyprint">Intent intent = getIntent();
overridePendingTransition(0, 0);
intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);
finish();
overridePendingTransition(0, 0);
startActivity(intent);</pre>
</div>
<div><em><strong>Note:</strong> The second approach works only from API 5+</em></div>
