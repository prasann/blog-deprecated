<div class="post">
<p>After started using <strong>Sublime Text 2 (ST2)</strong>, was completely head over heels for it. After using it for some time, figured out that ST2 uses a settings file to remember the plugins, open tabs etc. I was using my laptop (Mac) and sometimes uses my PC (Windows) do type blog post or some other stuff. So thought of giving a try in syncing these two using Dropbox folder.</p>
<p>The idea is to have the settings file in the Dropbox folder and to have a symlink in the OS to point to. This means whatever changes i did to a ST2 instance will reflect in my other instance too.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Install ST2 in both the machines.</li>
<li>Have a DropBox account and install the software in both the machines.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>In Mac:</strong></h3>
<p>Move the entire Sublime Text folder into the Dropbox folder.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">mv '~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/' '~/Dropbox/Sublime\ Text\ 2'</pre>
<p>Next step is to create a symlink in the original location so that it the folder in the Dropbox will be used to store the settings.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">ln -s '~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2' '~/Dropbox/Sublime\ Text\ 2'</pre>
<h3><strong>In Windows:</strong></h3>
<p>Windows don't have symlink concept. So we have to settle with <a title="NTFS Junction Point" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link">NTFS symbolic link</a></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">mklink /J 'C:/Users/user_name/Dropbox/Sublime Text 2' 'C:/User/user_name/Applications/Sublime Text 2'</pre>
<p>That's it, now you don't need to worry about the sync between these two instances.</p>
