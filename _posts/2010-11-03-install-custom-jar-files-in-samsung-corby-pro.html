<div class="post">
<p>Installing jar applications using Corby Pro is not straightforward. I tried multiple ways and finally found an easy solution !!!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In your PC.</span></strong><br />
* Download a jar ( Check whether it will work with Smasung Corby)<br />
* Create a HTML file as mentioned below.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;a href="jar_name.jar"&gt;Jar Name&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
<p>* Now transfer both these files to your mobile phone. (Make sure you have both these files in the same location/folder)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In your Mobile:</span></strong><br />
* Navigate to your HTML file and click to open it on your browser.<br />
* You can see a link on your browser with the Jar Name you specified in the HTML.<br />
* Click on the link and you are done !!!</p>
