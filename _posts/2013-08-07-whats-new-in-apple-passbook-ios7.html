<div class="post">
<p>I'm currently working in a project that integrated with iOS Passbook application to deliver digital passes to their users. Spent some time in investigating the changes to passbook application in iOS7 (beta 4). Here is a quick summary of it.</p>
<p>Apple listened to its user's feedback and have come with some features which increases the usability of the application.</p>
<p><strong>Add multiple passes to Passbook.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can able to add multiple passes to the Passbook application in one go. So, if you are issuing multiple passes to your users, probably have a page with all the passes and you can have download all link, which downloads all the passes in one shot.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery through Barcode.</strong></p>
<p>Apple have added one more delivery mechanism to the passbook. Currently you can deliver a pass through Safari browser (with vnd.apple.pkpass as header)Â or Through email attachment or to stream from your native iOS application. Now in the new passbook app they have added a barcode scanner. So the content of the pass can be crisped into a barcode and can be delivered to the Passbook application.</p>
<p><strong>Anchor tags at the back of the pass.</strong></p>
<p>Currently you can have links, but you cannot have link text. For example if you want to link 
	<a href="http://google.com">http://www.google.com</a> to 'Click here' it is not possible. But it will be possible from iOS7</p>
<p><strong>Expiration date for Passes.</strong></p>
<p>Now passes can have its own expiration date. It's a meta data that you can set and after that the passes will be destroyed from the Apple passbook automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Usage restriction by Geo location.</strong></p>
<p>You can restrict the usage of passes, within a specific geo location. For example if you are issuing a coupon, then you can make sure that your users could able to access the coupons within a specific geo co-ordinates.</p>
<p>All these are nice features that are provided in iOS7. So far i was happy with all these news, until i read that, (<a href="https://devforums.apple.com/thread/190987?tstart=0">Dev forum link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The rendering algorithms are significantly different from the previous versions.</strong></p>
<p>This seems to be a major issue to me, since i have to now test the appearance of my pass with new version. And have to think about optimising the design across all the versions.</p>
