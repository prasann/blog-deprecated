<div class="post">
<p><strong>SetUp:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download <a title="virtualbox" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> and install it.</li>
<li>Get Microsoft <a title="Windows 8" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516" target="_blank">Windows 8 developer edition.</a></li>
<li>The latest VirtualBox has an option to choose Windows 8 as an operating system, so chose it and locate the Windows iso file.</li>
</ul>
<p>And also i chose local account for installing as i didn't have Windows Live ID and thought creating a new one might be time consuming.</p>
<p>Thats it.</p>

<p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong><br />
So far im not too much convinced about the feel of it. Did try hard to map the multitouch touchpad to windows events, but its not seamless.<br />
The horizontal scrolling of the start page is getting stuck frequently. Apart from the brand new start screen i couldn't find anything interesting.</p>
<p>Anyways its good to try this stuff.</p>
