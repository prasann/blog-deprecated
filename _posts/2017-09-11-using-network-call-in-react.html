meta-description: React documentation suggests to use componentDidMount for async calls. Here is the explanation of why you shouldn't do in constructor or in componentWillMount.

<div class="post">

  <p>All network calls that are necessary to load data needed by the component should go inside <span class="inline">componentDidMount()</span>
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <h5><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount" target="_blank">
      From React docs</a></h5>
    <span class="inline">componentDidMount()</span> is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. Initialization
    that requires DOM nodes should go here.
    If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to
    instantiate the network request. Setting state in this method will trigger a re-rendering.
  </blockquote>

  <h4>Why not inside <span class="inline">constructor()</span>?</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If you make a fetch for a component in constructor, and the user navigates away from the page containing that
      component before the request completes, it will still try to <span class="inline">setState</span> on that
      component despite being unmounted,
      and React will throw an error.
    </li>

    <li>If your component fails to load, still you will end up making an unnecessary server-request.</li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Why not in <span class="inline">componenentWillMount()</span>?</h4>

  <p>
    This function is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. So, obviously this appears to be a best place to place
    the call to load data.
    However that's not the case.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Even if you add the network call in componentWillMount, your request will almost certainly not finish before the
      component is rendered. There is no way to pause the rendering till the request returns.
      So you will end up re-rendering the component anyways.
    </li>
    <li>
      This is the only lifecycle hook called on server rendering. So, if you are serving from the backend, this will be
      executed twice.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
