<div class="post">
<p>I stumbled upon a situation where i have to print multiple sections of a page into a single document. I actually tried out my own javascript to render only the required divs into an iframe and then the idea is to print that iframe calling <i>window.print()</i> in that iframe. </p>
<p>Having limited Javascript knowledge the above mentioned task was a bit tedious to me , then i sat upon googling to get a ready made plugin that implements this feature and my search ended upon <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jqPrint">Jqprint</a>. Jqprint is a plugin written in Jquery and it does the same that i mentioned above. Using this jqprint was really very easy. what all you need to do is that just mark all the divs that you want to print with a specific class name or with id. If your classname is printdiv  then all you need to do is just call &nbsp;<i>$(".printdiv").jqprint();</i></p>
