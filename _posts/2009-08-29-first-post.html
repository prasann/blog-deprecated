<div class="post">
  <p>So after writing lots of shits and craps in various blogs now I have decided to have my own blog (another one :P) to continue writing those same shits and craps.</p>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>All the writings made in this blog are my own thoughts, opinions, views, suggestions, impressions, feelings, beliefs, faiths, sentiments, notions, thinking and ideas. In short this blog is written by me considering myself as its only reader. If you accidently landed on any of the posts here Iâ€™m not responsible for its consequences.</p>
