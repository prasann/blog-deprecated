<div class="post">
<p>Just now i got my new MBP pre loaded with Lion OSX and one of the surprises i stepped onto is NTFS write issue on the Mac.</p>
<p>Based on a few blog posts and comments I managed to find a way that worked for me, so I thought Iâ€™d put it all here in one place for others.</p>
<p><strong>Pre requisites:</strong></p>
<p>Get <a title="homebrew" href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" target="_blank">HomeBrew</a> installed in your machine. And of course this needs XCode tools to be installed.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<p>1) Install latest Fuse4X (a fork of MacFUSE) and NTFS-3G packages:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">brew install fuse4x
brew install ntfs-3g</pre>
<p>2) Type brew info fuse4x-kext in the terminal. You will be shown a message similar to this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">In order for FUSE-based filesystems to work, the fuse4x kernel extension
must be installed by the root user:
sudo cp -rfX /usr/local/Cellar/fuse4x-kext/0.8.13/Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext /System/Library/Extensions
sudo chmod +s /System/Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext/Support/load_fuse4x</pre>
<p>Perform both the operation.<br />
3) And after this i simply followed this <a href="http://fernandoff.posterous.com/ntfs-write-support-on-osx-lion-with-ntfs-3g-f" target="_blank">blog post entry</a>. Since you have already installed Fuse4x and ntfs-3g you can directly jump to</p>
<blockquote><p>"Ok, at this point you should have a functional fuse4x and ntfs-3g install."</p></blockquote>
<p>and create an alternative</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">/sbin/ntfs_mount</pre>
<p>script as described there.<br />
And at last you got make one change to get things working.<br />
The script in the bog post is for MacPort users. For HomveBrew users you got to make this change.<br />
replace</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">/opt/local/bin/ntfs-3g</pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">/usr/local/bin/ntfs-3g</pre>
<p>And that's it. Just try mounting a NTFS drive and you should have write permissions to your drive. If you face any issues check out the log @</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">/var/log/ntfsmnt.log</pre>
<p>or try re-booting the machine in the worst case.</p>
