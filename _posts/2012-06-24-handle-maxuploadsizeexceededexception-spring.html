<div class="post">
<p>I was doing a AJAX file upload using jQuery and Spring 3. Spring provides a way to limit the file being uploaded and this can be configured while creating the multipart bean by specifying the maxUploadSize parameter.</p>
<p>So whenever an user tries to upload a file with size size greater than that of the specified one then Spring will throw<em> 'MaxUploadSizeExceededException'</em> exception and returns back. The problem for me is that i was doing the file upload using AJAX so i wanted a custom error to be thrown rather than the Spring's default error.</p>
<p>And also because of this exception the control will not even reach your specified controller so there is no chance to catch it in your Controller. After some lookup i found this simple fix for it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FileUploadController: Controller which will handle the file upload request.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Make this FileUploadController to implement HandlerExceptionResolver. This will force you to define resolveException() method.</strong></em></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">    
  @ResponseBody
  public ModelAndView resolveException(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, 
            HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse, Object o, Exception e) {
      if (e instanceof MaxUploadSizeExceededException) {
          ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("inline-error");
          modelAndView.addObject("error", "Error: Your file size is too large to upload. 
                    Please upload a file of size &lt; 5MB and continue.");
          return modelAndView;
      }
      e.printStackTrace();
      return new ModelAndView("500");
  }</pre>
<p><strong> How to show the error on the same page:</strong></p>
<p>The call to the controller is from a jQuery ajax method. But the problem here is that even with this approach your jQuery POST method is going to receive a HTTP_OK message from the controller. Hence if you are waiting at the error callback then you have no chance of catching this error.</p>
<p>So what i have done here is to return inline-error view back as the response. On the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">success</span> callback of the jQuery i check for the presence of the error_div in the response and display the field in the page. Else show the success message.</p>
<p><em>inline-error.jsp</em></p>
<pre class="brush:plain">&lt;div class="error" id="error_div"&gt;${error}&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>PS: This is definitely not the cleanest approach, but this solved my problem :)</em></span></p>
