*Always put your network call to load data in componentDidMount()*

>_From React docs_ ::  `componentDidMount()` is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request. Setting state in this method will trigger a re-rendering.

*Why  not a constructor()?*

* If you make a fetch for a component in constructor, and the user navigates away from the page containing that component before the request completes,  it will still try to setState on that component despite being unmounted, and React will throw an error.

* If your component fails to load, still you will end up making a server-request unnecessarily.

*Why not in componenentWillMount()?*
